Object recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (Capstone project in VIT) â€“ Purpose of this project is to identify whether an object is present in an image or not. Developed a Convolutional neural network using Python in order to increase accuracy and minimize the time to train the huge dataset.  CIFAR-10 dataset is used for training and testing purpose.
